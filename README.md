# Day7-with-java

Today is day 7 of my coding journey. Every day I am working on a new topic, practicing it and uploading here. 

Today I have learned about arrays. In java arrays are the objects. And these objects must have refence. 

In java while creating java, we have to activate the JVM(Java virtual machine). To assign a value in an array we will write the index of element in a square bracket[].

Need for an array: Whenever we want to store large collection of data, where data is of same type.

Advantages of array:

1. creation is easy

2. Access is also easy

we have to observe mainly 3 criteria before creating an array. They are 

1. Dimentionality(eg: 1D or 2D or 3D)

2. Homogeneous or Heterogeneous

3. Regular or Jagged data

Here are some example to demonstrate the above 3 criteria. 

Example1: Let us assume to find the age of 3 girls in a room. In this example, we are collecting ages  of 3 girls in the room. So all ages belongs to integer type only. So it will comes under Homogeneous and here we are having data of 3 girls in a room so it comes to 1d array, also it is regular data.

Example2: let us assume there are 2 floors each floor is having 4 rooms and in each room is filled with 3 girls. In this example also we are collecting ages only. so all ages belongs to same datatype i.e integers. So it is homogeneous type. Here to find ages, we have data as like floors and rooms. So it is 2d array. And finally coming to the data, we are having same number of people in each room so it is regular data.

In simply we can define regular array as if we have equal number of columns in each row then we call it as regular array. In other words we can call regular array as  rectangular array.

If each row is having unequal number of columns then it is jacked array.
